# Voting on Minswap Governance Proposals

Minswap's governance lets **$MIN** holders decide the protocol's future. This guide explains how to read a proposal, cast your vote, and what metadata to check.

---

## Understand the proposal view

- **Proposal details (red area in screenshot)**  
  Links, references, and context so you know exactly what you're voting on (e.g., Cardanoscan links, treasury addresses, summary text).

- **Cast your vote (green area)**  
  The options defined by the proposer (e.g., "Yes, pass the proposal" / "No, do not pass the proposal").

- **Votes list (blue area)**  
  Current votes showing a partial wallet address, the voter's choice, and their **voting power**.

## How to vote

1. **Open an active proposal**  
   Go to the Governance page and select a proposal in the *Active* phase.

2. **Review the details**  
   Read the summary and follow any links provided to fully understand the proposal.

3. **Choose your option**  
   In **Cast your vote**, select your preference.

4. **Click _Vote_**  
   Then confirm.

5. **Sign the transaction**  
   Approve in your wallet to record the vote **on‑chain**.

6. **Done**  
   Your vote appears in the votes list with your wallet's voting power.

> **Tip:** Voting power is determined by the **$MIN** you held at the **snapshot** time. Ensure your MIN is in your wallet before the snapshot.

## Governance phases (recap)
