# Creating a Governance Proposal on Minswap

Minswap‚Äôs DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) allows its community to directly shape the protocol‚Äôs future. By creating governance proposals, $MIN token holders can suggest improvements, request treasury funding, or adjust key parameters that affect the protocol. This ensures that Minswap remains transparent, community-driven, and aligned with the needs of its users.

## Why Create a Governance Proposal?

A governance proposal is your opportunity to influence the future of Minswap. By submitting one, you can:

- Suggest updates to fee structures, farming pools, or treasury allocations.
- Propose new initiatives that benefit the ecosystem.
- Secure funding for community projects, audits, or tooling.
- Ensure the protocol evolves in a decentralised, transparent way.

In short, proposals are how the community makes meaningful decisions together.

## The Two Types of Proposals

When starting a proposal, you must first choose the type:

### **Constitutional**
- These proposals amend the **DAO Operating Agreement** or its processes.
- Examples:
    - Updating fee-sharing mechanisms.
    - Revising governance parameters.
    - Adjusting quorums or legal obligations.
    - Changing token mechanisms or addressing high-risk issues.

### **Non-Constitutional**
- These proposals are less formal and focus on **funding or feature additions**.
- Examples:
    - Requesting treasury grants.
    - Introducing new protocol features without smart contract changes.
    - Establishing working groups.

## The Two Phases of Proposals

Every proposal goes through two voting phases:

### **Phase 1: Temperature Check**
- Duration: **1 week**.
- Purpose: To gauge community interest with a preliminary vote.
- Outcome: If approved, the proposal advances to the **Official Vote**.

### **Phase 2: Official Vote**
- Duration: **1 week**.
- Purpose: The DAO makes its **final decision** on your proposal.
- Outcome: If approved, the proposal is enacted.

This two-step process ensures that ideas are discussed, refined, and only implemented if they receive broad community support.

## Submitting a Proposal for Discussion

Before making an on-chain proposal, you must first share your idea on the **Minswap Governance Forum**:  
üëâ [Minswap Proposal Forum](https://forum.minswap.org/c/proposals/7)

This allows the community to review, debate, and refine your proposal before it reaches a vote.
